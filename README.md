# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

I tried to build a credit card fraud detection system using various supervised machine learning models.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a credit card transaction dataset containing information about various transactions, including features derived from the transaction details and a target variable (Class) indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (Class 1) or not (Class 0).

The dataset has the following columns:
- Time: Timestamp of the transaction
- V1-V28: Anonymized features from the original data
- Amount: Transaction amount
- Class: Target variable, 1 indicates fraud, 0 indicates legitimate transaction


**Model - 1**
